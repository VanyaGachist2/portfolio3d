        <p className="about__subtitle">My name is Vanya, I'm from Crimea Russia.
        My path to choosing a developer's profession began in the 7th grade, since I loved everything related to the computer since childhood, and when I saw the teacher in computer science lesson how he codes, I decided that I would become a programmer.
In 11th grade, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to do web development. I am inspired by the opportunity to create beautiful and functional products, as well as enjoy the process of writing code that turns into something beautiful.
At the moment, I am studying to become a programmer at the university, but I realized that in order to achieve my goal of becoming a web developer, I need additional training. Therefore, I decided to take a course from Yandex, which gave me the necessary boost to study new technologies and develop in this area.
I am currently studying the new TypeScript technology, as I have already encountered the problem of JavaScript when writing projects and decided to learn this programming language.
In the future, I want to develop further in the front end, and then I can try in the back-end.
